<p class="lead text-justify">
    <h5 class="text-left">What's Changed</h5>
    <b>Scripting</b>
    <ul>
        <li>More scripting API functions</li>
        <li>More example scripts</li>
        <li>Voxel.js: Render your sprite's layers as a 3D object and export an STL.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <b>Translation</b>
    <ul>
        <li>LibreSprite's UI now has preliminary (machine) translations for the following languages: English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Hindi, Indonesian, Russian.</li>
        <li>Currently there is no support for right-to-left languages.</li>
        <li>The UI now uses a TTF font in order to render all of the special characters legibly. If text looks blurry to you, make sure you set the Screen Scaling to 1.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />    
    <b>Pen Pressure</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial support for drawing tablets like the XP Pen Artist 12 and compatible Androids such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Note. The brush tool's size will automatically vary according to the pen pressure.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <b>Bug Fixes</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of bugs have been fixed, including multiple crashes and a "feature" that prevented Macs from sleeping while LibreSprite was running.</li>
        <li>Fixed the community quilt being way too big in the home screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-left">LibreSprite Dotto! is coming to town üéÑ </h4>
    <h6 class="text-left">January 25th 2022</h6>
</p>
    <br>
<p class="lead text-justify">
    The ones following the development might have noticed how our GitHub went silent in these weeks (Months by now). But that's not totally true, as we kept working behind the curtainsüë∑ <br>
    <br>
    Since we were facing too many problems with LibreSprite code structure, we opted for a completely rewrite of it (yes, we're that crazy) as it would take us less than cleaning the current code as we go. And changed the name, since it's a complete rewrite. <br>
    <br>
    So, tadaa, shake it a bit, add a good dose of @FManga, and you obtain LibreSprite Dotto!
    Yes, LibreSprite Dotto! is a work in progress, but it already supports things like scripting, multiple windows management, skins/themes, and so on. Not bad if you ask me ü§∑ <br>
    <br>
    We'll update you from time to time about what's happening in the new <a href="#!/news">NEWS</a> section and, if you want to follow the development, here is the <a href="https://github.com/LibreSprite/Dotto">repo</a>
