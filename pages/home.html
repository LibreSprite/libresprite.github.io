<h3>Great News!</h3>
<h5>LibreSprite Dotto! is coming to town ðŸŽ„</h5>
<br />
<p class="text-justify">
    The ones following the development might have noticed how our GitHub went
    silent in these weeks (Months by now). But that's not totally true, as we
    kept working behind the curtainsðŸ‘· <br />
    <br />
    Since we were facing too many problems with LibreSprite code structure, we
    opted for a completely rewrite of it (yes, we're that crazy) as it would
    take us less than cleaning the current code as we go. And changed the name,
    since it's a complete rewrite. <br />
    <br />
    So, tadaa, shake it a bit, add a good dose of @FManga, and you obtain
    LibreSprite Dotto! Yes, LibreSprite Dotto! is a work in progress, but it
    already supports things like scripting, multiple windows management,
    skins/themes, and so on. Not bad if you ask me ðŸ¤· <br />
    <br />
    We'll update you from time to time about what's happening in the new
    <a href="#!/news">NEWS</a> section and, if you want to follow the
    development, here is the
    <a href="https://github.com/LibreSprite/Dotto">repo</a>
